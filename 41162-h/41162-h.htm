Lord God of heaven that with mercy dight<br />
Th' alternate prayer-wheel of the night and light<br />
Eternal hath to thee, and in whose sight<br />
Our days as rain drops in the sea surge fall,<br />
<br />
As bright white drops upon a leaden sea<br />
Grant so my songs to this grey folk may be:<br />

As drops that dream and gleam and falling catch the sun,<br />
Evan'scent mirrors every opal one<br />
Of such his splendour as their compass is,<br />
So, bold My Songs, seek ye such death as this.<br />

<p class="center">SCENE: <i>The Ash Wood of Malvern.</i></p>

<p style="margin-left: 30%;"><br />
For I was a gaunt, grave councillor<br />
Being in all things wise, and very old,<br />
But I have put aside this folly and the cold<br />
That old age weareth for a cloak.<br />
<br />
I was quite strong&mdash;at least they said so&mdash;<br />
The young men at the sword-play;<br />
But I have put aside this folly, being gay<br />
In another fashion that more suiteth me.<br />
<br />
I have curled mid the boles of the ash wood,<br />
I have hidden my face where the oak<br />
Spread his leaves over me, and the yoke<br />
Of the old ways of men have I cast aside.<br />
<br />
By the still pool of Mar-nan-otha<br />
Have I found me a bride<br />
That was a dog-wood tree some syne.<br />
She hath called me from mine old ways<br />
She hath hushed my rancour of council,<br />
Bidding me praise<br />
<br />
Naught but the wind that flutters in the leaves.<br />
<br />
She hath drawn me from mine old ways,<br />
Till men say that I am mad;<br />
But I have seen the sorrow of men, and am glad,<br />
For I know that the wailing and bitterness are a folly.<br />
And I? I have put aside all folly and all grief.<br />
I wrapped my tears in an ellum leaf<br />
And left them under a stone<br />
And now men call me mad because I have thrown<br />
All folly from me, putting it aside<br />
To leave the old barren ways of men,<br />
Because my bride<br />
Is a pool of the wood, and<br />
Though all men say that I am mad<br />
It is only that I am glad,<br />
Very glad, for my bride hath toward me a great love<br />
That is sweeter than the love of women<br />
That plague and burn and drive one away.<br />
<br />
Aie-e! 'Tis true that I am gay<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Quite gay, for I have her alone here</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And no man troubleth us.</span><br />
<br />
Once when I was among the young men....<br />
And they said I was quite strong, among the young men.<br />
Once there was a woman....<br />
.... but I forget.... she was....<br />
.... I hope she will not come again.<br />
<br />
.... I do not remember....<br />
I think she hurt me once, but....<br />
That was very long ago.<br />
<br />
I do not like to remember things any more.<br />
<br />
I like one little band of winds that blow<br />
In the ash trees here:<br />
For we are quite alone<br />
Here mid the ash trees.<br />

<blockquote><p>NOTE: Any one who has read anything of the troubadours knows
well the tale of Bertran of Born and My Lady Maent of Montaignac,
and knows also the song he made when she would none
of him, the song wherein he, seeking to find or make her equal,
begs of each preeminent lady of Langue d'Oc some trait or some
fair semblance: thus of Cembelins her "esgart amoros" to wit,
her love-lit glance, of Aelis her speech free-running, of the Vicomptess
of Chales her throat and her two hands, at Roacoart of
Anhes her hair golden as Iseult's; and even in this fashion of Lady
Audiart "although she would that ill come unto him" he sought
and praised the lineaments of the torse. And all this to make
"Una dompna soiseubuda" a borrowed lady or as the Italians
translated it "Una donna ideale."</p></blockquote>

Though thou well dost wish me ill<br />
<span style="margin-left: 11.5em;">Audiart, Audiart,</span><br />

As ivy fingers clutching through<br />

I breathe no hope<br />
That thou shouldst....<br />
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">Nay no whit</span><br />
Bespeak thyself for anything.<br />
Just a word in thy praise, girl,<br />
Just for the swirl<br />
Thy satins make upon the stair,<br />
'Cause never a flaw was there<br />
Where thy torse and limbs are met:<br />
Though thou hate me, read it set<br />
In rose and gold.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a><br />

Upon thy hands, and thy old soul<br />
Scorning a new, wry'd casement<br />
Churlish at seemed misplacement<br />
Finds the earth as bitter<br />
As now seems it sweet,<br />
Being so young and fair<br />
As then only in dreams,<br />
Being then young and wry'd,<br />
Broken of ancient pride,<br />
Thou shalt then soften,<br />
Knowing I know not how<br />
Thou wert once she<br />

Sharing his exile that hath borne the flame,<br />
Joining his freedom that hath drunk the shame<br />
And known the torture of the Skull-place hours<br />
Free and so bound, that mingled with the powers<br />
Of air and sea and light his soul's far reach<br />
Yet strictured did the body-lips beseech<br />
"To drink" "I thirst." And then the sponge of gall.<br />

Wherefore we wastrels that the grey road's call<br />
Doth master and make slaves and yet make free,<br />
Drink all of life and quaffing lustily<br />
Take bitter with the sweet without complain<br />

We claim no glory. If the tempest rolls<br />
About us we have fear, and then<br />
Having so small a stake grow bold again.<br />
We know not definitely even this<br />
But 'cause some vague half knowing half doth miss<br />
Our consciousness and leaves us feeling<br />
That somehow all is well, that sober, reeling<br />
From the last carouse, or in what measure<br />
Of so called right or so damned wrong our leisure<br />
Runs out uncounted sand beneath the sun,<br />
That, spite your carping, still the thing is done<br />
With some deep sanction, that, we know not how,<br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"When I see thee as some poor song-bird</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Battering its wings, against this cage we</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Today,</span><br />
Then would I speak comfort unto thee,<br />
From out the heights I dwell in, when<br />
That great sense of power is upon me<br />
And I see my greater soul-self bending<br />
Sibylwise with that great forty year epic<br />
That you know of, yet unwrit<br />
But as some child's toy 'tween my fingers,<br />
And see the sculptors of new ages carve me thus,<br />
And model with the music of my couplets in their hearts:<br />
<br />
Surely if in the end the epic<br />
And the small kind deed are one;<br />
If to God the child's toy and the epic are the same,<br />
E'en so, did one make a child's toy,<br />
He might wright it well<br />
And cunningly, that the child might<br />
Keep it for his children's children<br />
And all have joy thereof.<br />
<br />
Dear, an this dream come true,<br />
Then shall all men say of thee<br />
"She 'twas that played him power at life's morn,<br />
And at the twilight Evensong,<br />
And God's peace dwelt in the mingled chords<br />
She drew from out the shadows of the past,<br />
And old world melodies that else<br />
He had known only in his dreams<br />
Of Iseult and of Beatrice.<br />
<br />
Dear, an this dream come true,<br />
I, who being poet only,<br />
Can give thee poor words only,<br />
Add this one poor other tribute,<br />
This thing men call immortality.<br />
A gift I give thee even as Ronsard gave it.<br />
Seeing before time, one sweet face grown old,<br />
And seeing the old eyes grow bright<br />
From out the border of Her fire-lit wrinkles,<br />
As she should make boast unto her maids<br />
"Ronsard hath sung the beauty, <i>my</i> beauty,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Of the days that I was fair."</span><br />
<br />
So hath the boon been given, by the poets of old time<br />
(Dante to Beatrice,&mdash;an I profane not&mdash;)<br />
Yet with my lesser power shall I not strive<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">To give it thee?</span><br />
<br />
All ends of things are with Him<br />
From whom are all things in their essence.<br />
If my power be lesser<br />
Shall my striving be less keen?<br />
But rather more! if I would reach the goal,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">Take then the striving!</span><br />
"And if," for so the Florentine hath writ<br />
When having put all his heart<br />
Into his "Youth's Dear Book"<br />
He yet strove to do more honour<br />
To that lady dwelling in his inmost soul<br />
He would wax yet greater<br />
To make her earthly glory more.<br />
Though sight of hell and heaven were price thereof,<br />
If so it be His will, with whom<br />
Are all things and through whom<br />
Are all things good,<br />
Will I make for thee and for the beauty of thy music<br />
A new thing<br />
As hath not heretofore been writ.<br />

Wherefore I made her a song and she went from me<br />

Saying "The soul sendeth us."<br />

And in vain I cried unto them "I have no song<br />

A woman as fire upon the pine woods<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">crying "Song, a song."</span><br />
As the flame crieth unto the sap.<br />
My song was ablaze with her and she went from me<br />
As flame leaveth the embers so went she unto new forests<br />
And the words were with me<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">crying ever "Song, a song."</span><br />

And I "I have no song,"<br />

Whither he went I may not follow him. His eyes<br />
Were strange to-day. They always were,<br />
After their fashion, kindred of the sea.<br />
<br />
To-day I found him. It is very long<br />
That I had sought among the nets, and when I asked<br />
The fishermen, they laughed at me.<br />
I sought long days amid the cliffs thinking to find<br />
The body-house of him, and then<br />
There at the blue cave-mouth my joy<br />
Grew pain for suddenness, to see him 'live.<br />
Whither he went I may not come, it seems<br />
He is become estranged from all the rest,<br />
And all the sea is now his wonder-house.<br />
And he may sink unto strange depths, he tells me of,<br />
That have no light as we it deem.<br />
E'en now he speaks strange words. I did not know<br />
One half the substance of his speech with me.<br />
And then when I saw naught he sudden leaped<br />
And shot, a gleam of silver, down, away.<br />
And I have spent three days upon this rock<br />
And yet he comes no more.<br />
He did not even seem to know<br />
I watched him gliding through the vitreous deep.<br />

They chide me that the skein I used to spin<br />
Holds not my interest now,<br />
They mock me at the route, well, I have come again.<br />
Last night I saw three white forms move<br />
Out past the utmost wave that bears the white foam crest.<br />
I somehow knew that he was one of them.<br />
<br />
Oimè, Oimè. I think each time they come<br />
Up from the sea heart to the realm of air<br />
They are more far-removed from the shore.<br />
When first I found him here, he slept<br />
E'en as he might after a long night's taking on the deep.<br />
And when he woke some whit the old kind smile<br />
Dwelt round his lips and held him near to me.<br />
But then strange gleams shot through the grey-deep eyes<br />
As though he saw beyond and saw not me.<br />
And when he moved to speak it troubled him.<br />
And then he plucked at grass and bade me eat.<br />
And then forgot me for the sea its charm<br />
And leapt him in the wave and so was gone.<br />

I wonder why he mocked me with the grass.<br />
I know not any more how long it is<br />
Since I have dwelt not in my mother's house.<br />
I know they think me mad, for all night long<br />
I haunt the sea-marge, thinking I may find<br />
Some day the herb he offered unto me.<br />
Perhaps he did not jest; they say some simples have<br />
More wide-spanned power than old wives draw from them.<br />
<br />
Perhaps, found I this grass, he'd come again.<br />
Perhaps 'tis some strange charm to draw him here,<br />
'Thout which he may not leave his new-found crew<br />
That ride the two-foot coursers of the deep,<br />
And laugh in storms and break the fishers' nets.<br />

To mock me now, all night, all night, and<br />
Have I strayed among the cliffs here<br />
They say, some day I'll fall<br />
Down through the sea-bit fissures, and no more<br />
Know the warm cloak of sun, or bathe<br />
The dew across my tired eyes to comfort them.<br />
They try to keep me hid within four walls.<br />
I will not stay!<br />

If only he would come some little while and find it me.<br />

I am homesick after mine own kind,<br />
Oh I know that there are folk about me, friendly faces,<br />
But I am homesick after mine own kind.<br />

"These sell our pictures"! Oh well,<br />
They reach me not, touch me some edge or that,<br />
But reach me not and all my life's become<br />
One flame, that reacheth not beyond<br />
Mine heart's own hearth,<br />
Or hides among the ashes there for thee.<br />

And burst forth to the windows only whiles or whiles<br />
For love, or hope, or beauty or for power,<br />

And are untouched by echoes of the world.<br />

Oh ye, my fellows: with the seas between us some be,<br />
Purple and sapphire for the silver shafts<br />
Of sun and spray all shattered at the bows<br />
Of such a "Veltro" of the vasty deep<br />
As bore my tortoise house scant years agone:<br />
And some the hills hold off,<br />
The little hills to east us, though here we<br />
Have damp and plain to be our shutting in.<br />
<br />
And yet my soul sings "Up!" and we are one.<br />
Yea thou, and Thou, and THOU, and all my kin<br />
To whom my breast and arms are ever warm,<br />
For that I love ye as the wind the trees<br />
That holds their blossoms and their leaves in cure<br />
And calls the utmost singing from the boughs<br />
That 'thout him, save the aspen, were as dumb<br />
Still shade, and bade no whisper speak the birds of how<br />

<h4>A Vision of Italy</h4>


<p style="margin-left: 30%;">
Wisdom set apart from all desire,<br />
A hoary Nestor with youth's own glad eyes,<br />
Him met I at the style, and all benign<br />
He greeted me an equal and I knew,<br />
By this his lack of pomp, he was himself.<br />
<br />
Slow-Smiling is companion unto him,<br />
And Mellow-Laughter serves, his trencherman.<br />
And I a thousand beauties there beheld.<br />
And he and they made merry endlessly.<br />
And love was rayed between them as a mist,<br />
And yet so fine and delicate a haze<br />
It did impede the eyes no whit,<br />
Unless it were to make the halo round each one<br />
Appear more myriad-jewelled marvellous,<br />
Than any pearled and ruby diadem the courts o' earth<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">ha' known.</span><br />
<br />
Slender as mist-wrought maids and hamadryads<br />
Did meseem these shapes that ministered,<br />
These formed harmonies with lake-deep eyes,<br />
And first the cities of north Italy<br />
I did behold,<br />
Each as a woman wonder-fair,<br />
And svelte Verona first I met at eve;<br />
And in the dark we kissed and then the way<br />
Bore us somewhile apart.<br />
And yet my heart keeps tryst with her,<br />
So every year our thoughts are interwove<br />
As fingers were, such times as eyes see much, and tell.<br />
And she that loved the master years agone,<br />
That bears his signet in her "Signor Square,"<br />
"Che lo glorifico."<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">She spread her arms,</span><br />
And in that deep embrace<br />
All thoughts of woe were perished<br />
And of pain and weariness and all the wrack<br />
Of light-contending thoughts and battled-gleams,<br />
(That our intelligence doth gain by strife against itself)<br />
Of things we have not yet the earnèd right to clearly see.<br />
And all, yea all that dust doth symbolize<br />
Was there forgot, and my enfranchised soul<br />
Grew as the liquid elements, and was infused<br />
With joy that is not light, nor might nor harmony,<br />
And yet hath part and quality of all these three,<br />
Whereto is added calm past earthly peace.<br />
<br />
Thus with Verona's spirit, and all time<br />
Swept on beyond my ken, and as the sea<br />
Hath in no wise a form within itself,<br />
<i>Cioè</i>, as liquid hath no form save where it bounden is<br />
By some enshrouding chalice of hard things&mdash;<br />
As wine its graven goblet, and the sea<br />
Its wave-hewn basalt for a bordering,<br />
So had my thought and now my thought's remembrance<br />
No "<i>in</i>formation" of whatso there passed<br />
For this long space the dream-king's horny gate.<br />
<br />
And when that age was done and the transfusion<br />
Of all my self through her and she through me,<br />
I did perceive that she enthroned two things:<br />
Verona, and a maid I knew on earth;<br />
And dulled some while from dream, and then become<br />
That lower thing, deductive intellect, I saw<br />
How all things are but symbols of all things,<a name="FNanchor_10_9" id="FNanchor_10_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_9" class="fnanchor">[10]</a><br />
And each of many, do we know<br />
But the equation governing.<br />
And in my rapture at this vision's scope<br />
I saw no end or bourn to what things mean,<br />
So praised Pythagoras and once more raised<br />
By this said rapture to the house of Dream,<br />
Beheld Fenicè as a lotus-flower<br />
Drift through the purple of the wedded sea<br />
And grow a wraith and then a dark-eyed she,<br />
And knew her name was "All-forgetfulness,"<br />
And hailed her: "Princess of the Opiates,"<br />
And guessed her evil and her good thereby.<br />
<br />
And then a maid of nine "Pavia" hight,<br />
Passed with a laugh that was all mystery,<br />
And when I turned to her<br />
She reached me one clear chalice of white wine,<br />
Pressed from the recent grapes that yet were hung<br />
Adown her shoulders, and were bound<br />
Right cunningly about her elfish brows;<br />
So hale a draught, the life of every grape<br />
Lurked without ferment in the amber cloud.<br />
And memory, this wine was, of all good.<br />
<br />
And more I might have seen: Firenza, Goito,<br />
Or that proudest gate, Ligurian Genoa,<br />
Cornelia of Colombo of far sight,<br />
That, man and seer in one, had well been twain,<br />
And each a glory to his hills and sea;<br />
And past her a great band<br />
Bright garlanded or rich with purple skeins,<br />
And crimson mantles and queynt fineries<br />
That tarnished held but so the more<br />
Of dim allurement in their half-shown folds:<br />
So swept my vision o'er their filmy ranks,<br />
Then rose some opaque cloud,<br />
Whose name I have not yet discerned,<br />
And music as I heard it one clear night<br />
Within our earthly night's own mirroring,<br />
<i>Cioè</i>,&mdash;San Pietro by Adige,<a name="FNanchor_11_9" id="FNanchor_11_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_9" class="fnanchor">[11]</a><br />
Where altar candles blazed out as dim stars,<br />
And all the gloom was soft, and shadowy forms<br />
Made and sang God, within the far-off choir.<br />
And in a clear space high behind<br />
Them and the tabernacle of that place,<br />
Two tapers shew the master of the keys<br />
As some white power pouring forth itself.<br />
<br />
And all the church rang low and murmured<br />
Thus in my dream of forms the music swayed.<br />
And I was lost in it and only woke<br />
When something like a mass bell rang, and then<br />
That white-foot wind, pale Dawn's annunciatrice.<br />
Me bore to earth again, but some strange peace<br />
I had not known so well before this swevyn<br />
Clung round my head and made me hate earth less.<br />

I do not choose to dream; there cometh on me<br />

Brings momentary life and long-fled cunning,<br />

<blockquote><p style="font-size: 0.8em;">The song of Peire Bremon "Lo Tort" that he made for his
Lady in Provença: he being in Syria a crusader.</p></blockquote>


<p style="margin-left: 30%;">
In April when I see all through<br />
Mead and garden new flowers blow,<br />
And streams with ice-bands broken flow,<br />
Eke hear the birds their singing do;<br />
When spring's grass-perfume floateth by<br />
Then 'tis sweet song and birdlet's cry<br />
Do make mine old joy come anew.<br />
<br />
Such time was wont my thought of old<br />
To wander in the ways of love.<br />
Burnishing arms and clang thereof,<br />
And honour-services manifold<br />
Be now my need. Whoso combine<br />
Such works, love is his bread and wine,<br />
Wherefore should his fight the more be bold.<br />
<br />
Song bear I, who tears should bring<br />
Sith ire of love mak'th me annoy,<br />
With song think I to make me joy.<br />
Yet ne'er have I heard said this thing:<br />
"He sings who sorrow's guise should wear."<br />
Natheless I will not despair<br />
That sometime I'll have cause to sing.<br />
<br />
I should not to despair give way<br />
That some while I'll my lady see.<br />
I trust well He that lowered me<br />
Hath power again to make me gay.<br />
But if e'er I come to my Love's land<br />
And turn again to Syrian strand,<br />
God keep me there for a fool, alway!<br />
<br />
God for a miracle well should<br />
Hold my coming from her away,<br />
And hold me in His grace alway<br />
That I left her, for holy-rood.<br />
An I lose her, no joy for me,<br />
Pardi, hath the wide world in fee.<br />
Nor could He mend it, if He would.<br />
<br />
Well did she know sweet wiles to take<br />
My heart, when thence I took my way.<br />
'Thout sighing, pass I ne'er a day<br />
For that sweet semblance she did make<br />
To me, saying all in sorrow:<br />
"Sweet friend, and what of me to-morrow?"<br />
"Love mine, why wilt me so forsake?"<br />
<br />
<br />
ENVOI<br />
<br />
Beyond sea be thou sped, my song,<br />
And, by God, to my Lady say<br />
That in desirous, grief-filled way<br />
My nights and my days are full long.<br />
And command thou William the Long-Seer<br />
To tell thee to my Lady dear,<br />
That comfort be her thoughts among.<br />
</p>

A poor clerk I, "Arnaut the less" they call me,<br />
And because I have small mind to sit<br />
Day long, long day cooped on a stool<br />
A-jumbling o' figures for Maitre Jacques Polin,<br />
I ha' taken to rambling the South here.<br />
<br />
The Vicomte of Beziers's not such a bad lot.<br />
I made rimes to his lady this three year:<br />
Vers and canzone, till that damn'd son of Aragon,<br />
Alfonso the half-bald, took to hanging<br />
<i>His</i> helmet at Beziers.<br />

Beziers off at Mont-Ausier, I and his lady<br />
Singing the stars in the turrets of Beziers,<br />
And one lean Aragonese cursing the seneschal<br />
To the end that you see, friends:<br />
<br />
Aragon cursing in Aragon, Beziers busy at Beziers&mdash;<br />
Bored to an inch of extinction,<br />
Tibors all tongue and temper at Mont-Ausier,<br />

They take the trouble to tear out this wall here,<br />
They'll know more of Arnaut of Marvoil<br />
Than half his canzoni say of him.<br />
As for will and testament I leave none,<br />
Save this: "Vers and canzone to the Countess of Beziers<br />
In return for the first kiss she gave me."<br />
May her eyes and her cheek be fair<br />
To all men except the King of Aragon,<br />
And may I come speedily to Beziers<br />
Whither my desire and my dream have preceded me.<br />
O hole in the wall here! be thou my jongleur<br />
As ne'er had I other, and when the wind blows,<br />
Sing thou the grace of the Lady of Beziers,<br />
For even as thou art hollow before I fill thee with<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">this parchment,</span><br />
So is my heart hollow when she filleth not mine eyes,<br />
And so were my mind hollow, did she not fill utterly<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">my thought.</span><br />
<br />
Wherefore, O hole in the wall here,<br />
When the wind blows sigh thou for my sorrow<br />
That I have not the Countess of Beziers<br />
Close in my arms here.<br />
Even as thou shalt soon have this parchment.<br />
<br />
O hole in the wall here, be thou my jongleur,<br />
And though thou sighest my sorrow in the wind,<br />
Keep yet my secret in thy breast here;<br />

was mercifully taken from me; as had one passed saying as one in
the Book of the Dead,</p>

<p>"I, lo I, am the assembler of souls," and had taken it with him
leaving me thus <i>simplex naturae</i>, even so at peace and transsentient
as a wood pool I made it.</p>

<p>The Legend thus: "Miraut de Garzelas, after the pains he bore
a-loving Riels of Calidorn and that to none avail, ran mad in the
forest.</p>

<p>"Yea even as Peire Vidal ran as a wolf for her of Penautier
though some say that twas folly or as Garulf Bisclavret so ran
truly, till the King brought him respite (See 'Lais' Marie de
France), so was he ever by the Ash Tree."</p>

<p>Hear ye his speaking: (low, slowly he speaketh it, as one drawn
apart, reflecting) (égaré).</p>

<p>1. "<i>che lo glorifico</i>." In the Piazza dei Signori, you will find
an inscription which translates thus:</p>

<p>"It is here Can Grande della Scala gave welcome to Dante
Alighieri, the <i>same which glorified him</i>, dedicating to him that
third his song eternal."</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">"C.G. vi accolse D.A. che lo</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">glorifico dedicandogli la terza,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">delle eterne sue cantiche."</span><br />
</p>

<p>2. Ref. Richard of St. Victor. "On the preparation of the soul
for contemplation," where he distinguishes between cogitation,
meditation, and contemplation.</p>

<p>In cogitation the thought or attention flits aimlessly about the
subject.</p>

<p>In meditation it circles round it, that is, it views it systematically,
from all sides, gaining perspective.</p>

<p>In contemplation it radiates from a centre, that is, as light from
the sun it reaches out in an infinite number of ways to things that
are related to or dependent on it.</p>

<p>The words above are my own, as I have not the Benjamin Minor
by me.</p>

<p>Following St. Victor's figure of radiation: Poetry in its acme
is expression from contemplation.</p>

<p>3. San Pietro Incarnato. There are several rows of houses intervening
between it and the river.</p>



<p>ALBA BELINGALIS</p>

<p>MS. in Latin, with refrain,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">"L alba par umet mar atras el poy</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Pas abigil miraclar Tenebris."</span><br />
</p>

<p>It was and may still be the oldest fragment of Provençal known.</p>



<p>MARVOIL</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Personae are:</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Arnaut of Marvoil, a troubadour, date 1170-1200.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Countess (in her own right) of Burlatz, and of Beziers, being</span><br />
the wife of<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Vicomte of Beziers.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Alfonso IV of Aragon.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Tibors of Mont-Ausier. For fuller mention of her see the</span><br />
"razos" on Bertran of Born. She is contemporary with the<br />
other persons, but I have no strict warrant for dragging her name<br />
into this particular affair.<br />
</p>

<p>Marco Londonio's Italian version of "Nel Biancheggiar":</p>

<p style="margin-left: 30%;">
Nel biancheggiar di delicata rosa<br />
Risplendono i colori<br />
D' occidentali fiori<br />
Prima che l'alba, in esultanza ascosa<br />
<br />
Voglia baciarli. Ed aleggiar io sento<br />
Qual su dolce lïuto<br />
Nel lor linguaggio muto<br />
Fiorir di gioia e tocco di tormento<br />
<br />
Cosi un' arcano senso di languore,<br />
Le sue sognanti dita<br />
Fanno scordar la vita<br />
Spirando in verso tutto pien d'amore....<br />
<br />
Senza morir: chè sanno i suoni alati,<br />
Vedendo il nostro stato,<br />
Ch' è dal dolor turbato,<br />
Di lasciarci, morendo, desolati.<br />
</p>
